## Contents

This folder contains a copy of generated-platform-cert-test-list.json, a file
generated in the `chip-test-plan` repository.

This file contains a list of the tests that are part of a platform certification
process. It is consumed by the `certification-tool-backend`.

It is hosted here since `chip-test-plan`, unlike this repo, is not public and is
not guaranteed to be accessible by a user of `certification-tool-backend`.

## How to update

The official update process is to be determined.

This file will be manually maintained by the Platform Certification Tiger Team
until we put together an automated process that will fetch the file directly
from the `chip-test-plan` repo through Github actions.
